//but infact they are not even tech sweeper 
// just remember one thing ,when code gets executed after npm install
// reducer run with default action type 
// this is the reason you will see some initialization in state property 
// to avoid undefined condition just to avoid error 
// then in react component map statetoprops is called ,passing required data
// thats it from react component ,you can produce n no of action
// creator n no of times ,reducer will catch will or will not modify state
// thus calling mapstatetoprops again ,which will pass modified 
// state to react component class with new rendering

// FUNCTION NAME UPDOWN
/ SO BEWARE HERE BODMAS RULE IS APPLICABLE..
// VAR A ="(F)";
// VAR B ="OOF";

typeof A=?
typeof B = ?
let me clarify OO is small o ok..
if i say typeof both A and B is similar to typeof "pleasureeeee"
is this statement  erect or wrong
it is correct bcz type of A ,B and "pleasureeeee" is string..

/// emojii jeee timeee
// // Two emoji characters, horse and shoe
let horseShoe = "🐴👟";
console.log(horseShoe.length);
// → 4
console.log(horseShoe[0]);
// → (Invalid half-character)
console.log(horseShoe.charCodeAt(0));
// → 55357 (Code of the half-character)
console.log(horseShoe.codePointAt(0));
// → 128052 (Actual code for horse emoji)
